## Abstract

## Software defined enterprises

Today's organizations are strongly analogic as they depend on a substancial amount of offline processes and interaction. While technology is becoming a key component of every business, the core of the organizations is still strongly analogic, relying on face to face decision making, work execution and evaluation.

In this white paper we're dealing with organization defined through code, where each interaction must be tracked online where each activity must be rapresented as either data or code.
