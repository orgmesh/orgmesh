## Abstract

## Software Defined Organizations

Organizations are the way in which the activities of human groups are coordinated and incentive aligned towards a common purpose.

Today's organizations are strongly analogic as they depend on a substantial amount of processes happening through offline interactions and decision making. While technology is becoming a key component of every human interaction, the core of each organizations is still strongly analogic, relying on face to face decision making, work execution and evaluation. In this way most of the key activities are left untracked. 

Here we're dealing with organizations defined through code, where each interaction must be tracked online and where each activity must be rapresented online, as either data or code, to be considered valid and normative.

Offline interaction can of course still happen, and this happen increasingly through electronic channels, but they must be inessential and volatile.

One key feature of the Software Defined Organizations that we envision is the ability for all user to keep the entire history of changes and activities visible, creating an immutable history of what has been done.

Software Defined Organizations can obey to different organization models, for example hyerarchical, matrix, decentralized. A software defined organization must manage its own organizational structure as code, as well as how it manages proposals and actual changes to its structure and business model.

Software Defined Organizations enable Decentralized Organizations, where every organization's activity happens through a collective, peer-to-peer org structure instead of a hyierarchical chain of command.

Also, SDO allows *pseudonymous organizations* to happen, where individuals do not necessarily need to discluse their identity in order to contribute work to the organization.

We believe Software Defined Organization are a key trend in the future of work.

## Software Defined Ecosystems

Organizations does not exist in a vacuum, and they need to respect laws and regulations. In order to allow the migrations of state laws and regulators in the ecosystem, we need to consider this functions in our model.

In real world, organization exists within or across states and are subject to multiple laws and regulations.

Also, laws and regulations need to adapt and evolve in time and each ecosystem legislative power.
