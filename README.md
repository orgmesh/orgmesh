## Abstract

## Software Defined Organizations

Organizations are the way in which the activities of human groups are coordinated and incentive aligned towards a common purpose.

Today's organizations are strongly analogic as they depend on a substantial amount of processes happening through offline interactions and decision making. While technology is becoming a key component of every human interaction, the core of each organizations is still strongly analogic, relying on face to face decision making, work execution and evaluation. In this way most of the key activities are left untracked. 

Here we're dealing with organizations defined through code, where each interaction must be tracked online and where each activity must be rapresented online, as either data or code, to be considered valid and normative.

Offline interaction can of course still happen, and this happen increasingly through electronic channels, but they must be inessential and volatile.

One key feature of the Software Defined Organizations that we envision is the ability for all user to keep the entire history of changes and activities visible, creating an immutable history of what has been done.

Software Defined Organizations can obey to different organization models, for example hyerarchical, matrix, decentralized. A software defined organization must manage its own organizational structure as code, as well as how it manages proposals and actual changes to its structure and business model.

Software Defined Organizations enable Decentralized Organizations, where every organization's activity happens through a collective, peer-to-peer org structure instead of a hyierarchical chain of command.

Also, SDO allows *pseudonymous organizations* to happen, where individuals do not necessarily need to discluse their identity in order to contribute work to the organization.

We believe Software Defined Organization are a key trend in the future of work.

## Software Defined Ecosystems

Organizations does not exist in a vacuum, and they need to respect laws and regulations. In order to allow the migrations of state laws and regulators in the ecosystem, we need to consider this functions in our model.

In real world, organization exists within or across states and are subject to multiple laws and regulations.

Ecosystems must include the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary powers.

Laws and regulations need to adapt and evolve in time, based on either permissioned or permissionless mechanisms.

A single SDO can align with one or more ecosystems. To do that, it must comply with laws and regulations and respect both Executive and Judiciary powers within the ecosystem.

Each ecosystem should be able to provide one or more templates for SDO (skeletons) that each organization should be able to extend.

Legislations are rule based. Each lay should be struvtured on Autority Documents, hierarchically structured.

## Organization Mesh

SDO are organized within a mesh. Each two SDO may have a relationship with shared data and processes.

For example, two organization collaborating on sales may share a list of opportunities


## Platforms for SDOs

Which is the best platform for Software Defined Organizations and Ecosystems.

In our opinion, SDOs must look at today's Low Code Application Platform-as-a-Service (LCAP). These platforms allows to define data models and workflows that suites centralized enterprises. The advantage of a low code platform is the possibility for everyone, unrespective of individual coding knowledge, to build upon the platform.

A decentralized LCAP can suites Software Defined Organizations and Ecosystems. 

No existing platform today can be considered a decentralized LCAP. 

Features of the dLCAP platform:

* Identity layer
* decentralized data dictionary
* decentralized workflow
* cryptocurrencies
* decentralized storage
* decentralized execution layer
* Oracles
* store
* User interface(s)

### Identity layer

### Decentralized data dictionary

### Decentralized workflow

BPM, IFTTT

### Cryptocurrencies

### Decentralized storage

### Decentralized execution layer

### Oracles

### Store

### User interface(s)
